## Key Features:

**Date Management:** Efficiently manages dates using the Date struct./
**Sorting: Utilizes** the sort function to arrange dates in chronological order.
**Validity Check**: Ensures validity of dates using the isValidDate method.
**User Interface** Provides clear output of original and sorted dates for user convenience.

## Potential Enhancements:
Integration of additional functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting dates.
Incorporation of file handling to save and load date data for persistence.
This program serves as a basic tool for managing and sorting dates, with potential for further development to include more comprehensive features.
